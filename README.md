# WPP-PY

# Usage
Open the Python script ```aula.py````` in your preferred text editor.

Customize the script by modifying the following parameters:

Mensagem1: The URL parameter used to compose the WhatsApp message.
Mensagem3: The text message to be sent along with the image.
Numeros: A list of phone numbers to send the messages to.

Run the script:

The script will automate the process of logging in to WhatsApp Web, selecting each contact from the Numeros list, attaching the image file, typing the text message, and sending it.

Please note that the script may take some time to execute, depending on the number of contacts and the speed of your internet connection.
